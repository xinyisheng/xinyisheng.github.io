# About Me

<img src="https://xinyisheng.com/sxy.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Xinyi Sheng (Ellie, 盛欣怡)**.

I am a junior undergrade majoring in Intelligence Science and Technology at Yunnan University. Recently this time I'm firmly stepping forward to the National Postgraduate Entrance Examination in Computer Science. While preparing for the NPEE, I tried hard not to get a FAIL.(NOOOO!) I'd love to play volleyball after class and serve mostly as a setter.

I'm quite pleasant to talk with you so just email me. My email address can be easily spotted on the side of the website.

## Research Interests

- Internet in Everything
- Computer/Intelligence Science and Technology
- Mathematics
- ALL content about the NPEE(Bless me)
- My latest research proposal (June 2025) (Future) (Here's the place for the interlinkage.)

School work of this semester are somewhat burdens to me. I paid a little interest in ** pattern recognition ** and ** innovative experimentation **. The former is a crucial subject in my major. And the latter, I found joy in building github pages. What I've learnt in class is expected to be applied in my resume as well as originality.
