## Research Interests

- Computer Science
- Intelligence Science and Technology
- Mathematics
- ALL content about the NPEE(Bless me)
- My latest research proposal (June 2025) (Future) (Here's the place for the interlinkage.)

School work of this semester are somewhat burdens to me. I paid a little interest in **pattern recognition** and **innovative experimentation**. The former is a crucial subject in my major. And the latter, I found joy in building github pages. What I've learnt in class is expected to be applied in my resume as well as originality.
